I'm a recent graduate from the **University of Edinburgh** in **BSc Ecological and Environmental Sciences**. 

During my years at university I've discovered a strong passion towards programming in **R**, dealing with **statistics and data modelling of environment-related data**. 

This interest pushed me further in deepening my current knowledge on data science matters, and that is why in October 2020 I joined **DASI: Data Arts for Social Impact**, to gain relevant knowledge and skills to become a fully formed **data scientist**. 

I am now about start a new journey as a data scientist at **Sopra Steria**.
