I'm a recent graduate from the **University of Edinburgh** in **BSc Ecological and Environmental Sciences**. 

During my years at university I've discovered a strong passion towards programming in **R**, dealing with **statistics and data modelling of environment-related data**. This interest pushed me further in deepening my current knowledge on data science matters, and that is why in October 2020 I joined **DASI: Data Arts and Science for Impact**, to gain relevant knowledge and skills to become a fully formed **data scientist**. 

You can contact me at this [email address](anna.chirumbolo@gmail.com).
