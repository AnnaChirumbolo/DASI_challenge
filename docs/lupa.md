# Lupa Water Spring

Lupa water spring presents one target variable, flow rate (L/s), and one feature: rainfall. 

We had a first look at the distribution of the target variable over time.

This water spring presents a particular anomaly from 2010 until 2020: a constant decreasing linear trend. Only before 2010 and from the beginning of 2020 there is a change in trend. This behaviour looks extremely artificial and unnatural, and for this reason we decided **not to continue analysing this dataset**. At least not until better data is collected.
